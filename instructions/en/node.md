**Fact**: Normally, Javascript and Node.js are installed together. However, you can install them separately. (I don't know why you would want to do that, but you can.)

## via Homebrew

### Step 1: Install Homebrew

> **NOTE**
> If you already have `Homebrew` installed, you can skip these steps.

Follow the instructions provided in the [installation homebrew](homebrew.md#install_homebrew) to install Homebrew on macOS.

### Step 2. Install Node.js

Run the following command to install Node.js:

```shell
brew install node
```

> **NOTE**
> Install Node.js using the command above will install the latest version of Node.js. If you want to install a specific version of Node.js, you can run the following command:

```shell
# brew install node@<version>
brew install node@18
```

## via Node.js installer

### Step 1. Download Node.js installer

1. Go to the [Node.js release page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/) and download the installer for your operating system.
